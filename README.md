# Kaggle Challenge: Predict Future Sales.
This repository aims to store my codes on Kaggle challenge called [Predict Future Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales)

# Data

- I have downloaded **test** and **train** data from the [competition webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data).
- I have downloaded **shop** and **item** information data from the English translations of [@deargle](https://www.kaggle.com/deargle) from [this post](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/discussion/54949). Then I have made some changes in the data described in this [R file](https://github.com/kazimanil/predict-future-sales/blob/master/data-manipulation-once-used.R).
- I have collected historical **USD/RUB** rates from [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/currencies/usd-rub-historical-data). I have used the most recent data for the days which does not include a rate info (i.e. Saturdays and Sundays which markets are closed).

# Process

- I will present an Exploratory Data Analysis on Kaggle (Kernel under construction).
- I will present an .R / .Rmd file describing how I predicted future sales (I will give a link ASAP).

# Output

- This section will provide my [RMSE scores](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales#evaluation) after my submission.
